# Local Pomodoro Timer with UI

## Objective

*Create a simple, desktop-based Pomodoro timer with a graphical user interface.*

## Feature Description

*The application will be a desktop app that allows users to start a Pomodoro timer. It will have configurable work and break intervals. When a session (work or break) ends, the user will be notified through the UI.*

### User Stories

*As a user, I want to see a visual representation of the timer so I can easily track the time.*
*As a user, I want to click buttons to start, stop, and reset the timer.*
*As a user, I want to be visually notified when a session is over.*
*As a user, I want to be able to configure the duration of the work and break sessions through the UI.*

## Technical Plan

### Technical Directives

*   **Programming Language:** Python 3.10+
*   **Frameworks/Libraries:** `tkinter` for the GUI.
*   **Database:** None required.
*   **Architectural Patterns:** The UI will be in a separate module from the main application logic.
*   **Code Style:** PEP 8

### Current State

*This feature has been implemented and is fully functional.*

### Proposed Changes

*   **File Changes:**
    *   `app/main.py`: This file launches the `tkinter` application.
    *   `app/ui.py`: This file contains the `PomodoroApp` class, which manages the UI and the timer logic.
    *   `tests/test_main.py`: This file contains unit tests for the timer logic.
*   **Data Model:** Not applicable.
*   **API Endpoints:** Not applicable.
*   **Dependencies:** No new external dependencies are required.

### Implementation Steps

1.  **UI Structure:** The main application window was created using `tkinter`.
2.  **UI Elements:** Labels, buttons, and input fields were added to the UI.
3.  **Timer Logic:** The countdown logic was implemented within the `PomodoroApp` class.
4.  **UI-Logic Connection:** The UI buttons were connected to the timer logic functions.
5.  **Notifications:** A `messagebox` is used to notify the user when a session ends.
6.  **App Launch:** `app/main.py` instantiates and runs the `PomodoroApp`.
7.  **Unit Tests:** Unit tests were written to verify the timer logic.

### Testing Strategy

*The feature was tested using a combination of unit tests and manual testing. The unit tests in `tests/test_main.py` cover the core timer logic, including starting, stopping, resetting, and setting custom durations. To test the timer's behavior at the end of a session without relying on the `tkinter` main loop, the `tkinter.Tk.after` method was patched. This allowed for the verification of the timer's state transitions and the display of notifications in a controlled and predictable manner. Manual testing was used to verify the overall user experience and the visual aspects of the GUI.*
