### 1. Project Initialization

**User:** "Create a new directory for my project, let's call it `my_new_project`."
**Agent:** `mkdir my_new_project`

**User:** "Now, initialize a Git repository inside `my_new_project`."
**Agent:** `cd my_new_project && git init`

**User:** "Set up a Python virtual environment within this new project directory."
**Agent:** `python -m venv venv`

**User:** "Activate the virtual environment."
**Agent:**
(Instructions for user based on OS, e.g., `.\venv\Scripts\activate` for Windows or `source venv/bin/activate` for macOS/Linux)

**User:** "Copy the essential project files and directories from the existing project's templates to `my_new_project`. This includes `.gitignore`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `requirements-dev.txt`, `requirements.txt`, the entire `.gemini/` directory, and the `docs/plans/plan_template.md`, `docs/plans/file_structure_template.md`, and `docs/plans/file_structure_assessment.md` files."
**Agent:**
(Executes a series of copy commands, e.g.,)
`cp TEMPLATE_PROJECT/.gitignore .`
`cp TEMPLATE_PROJECT/.pre-commit-config.yaml .`
`cp TEMPLATE_PROJECT/LICENSE .`
`cp TEMPLATE_PROJECT/README.md .`
`cp TEMPLATE_PROJECT/requirements-dev.txt .`
`cp TEMPLATE_PROJECT/requirements.txt .`
`cp -r TEMPLATE_PROJECT/.gemini .`
`mkdir -p docs/plans`
`cp TEMPLATE_PROJECT/docs/plans/plan_template.md docs/plans/`
`cp TEMPLATE_PROJECT/docs/plans/file_structure_template.md docs/plans/`
`cp TEMPLATE_PROJECT/docs/plans/file_structure_assessment.md docs/plans/`

**User:** "Install the development dependencies and set up the pre-commit hooks."
**Agent:** `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && pre-commit install`

---

### 2. Project Planning & High-Level Design

**User:** "Open `docs/plans/plan_template.md` for editing. I want to outline the project's purpose, main features, and a high-level architectural design here."
**Agent:** (Waits for user to edit the file. User would then manually open and edit the file in their preferred editor.)

**User:** "I've finished outlining the plan in `plan_template.md`. Save and close the file."
**Agent:** (Acknowledges, no direct action needed if user edited externally)

---

### 3. Core Application Implementation

**User:** "Based on the `docs/plans/file_structure_template.md`, create the basic application and test directory structure: `app/`, `tests/`, and `docs/images/`."
**Agent:** `mkdir app tests docs/images`

**User:** "Create the initial Python files: `app/__init__.py`, `app/main.py`, `app/ui.py`, `tests/__init__.py`, and `tests/test_main.py`."
**Agent:** `touch app/__init__.py app/main.py app/ui.py tests/__init__.py tests/test_main.py`

**User:** "Now, help me implement the core application logic in `app/main.py` and `app/ui.py`. Remember to incorporate the logging setup we used in the previous project, including the `--debug` argument."
**Agent:** (This is where the interactive implementation begins. The agent would likely ask for specifics, propose code snippets, and guide the user through writing the application, similar to how it assisted in the previous session.)

---

### 4. Testing and Verification

**User:** "I've implemented some features. Now, help me write unit tests for them in `tests/test_main.py`."
**Agent:** (Assists with test writing, potentially suggesting test cases or mocking strategies.)

**User:** "Run all the tests to verify the implementation."
**Agent:** `python -m pytest tests/`

**User:** "Run the linter and type checker to ensure code quality."
**Agent:** `ruff check app/ tests/ && mypy app/ tests/` (assuming `ruff` and `mypy` are installed and configured via `requirements-dev.txt` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`)

---

### 5. Version Control with Git & GitHub

**User:** "Show me the current status of the Git repository and stage all the new and modified files."
**Agent:** `git status && git add .`

**User:** "Commit these changes. Please suggest a good commit message for the initial project setup."
**Agent:**
(Proposes a commit message, e.g.,)
```
feat: Initial project setup and core application structure

This commit initializes the new project, sets up the basic file structure,
includes essential configuration files, and adds the initial application
and test files.
```
**User:** "Yes, commit with that message."
**Agent:** `git commit -m "feat: Initial project setup and core application structure..."`

**User:** "I've created a new empty repository on GitHub. What's the command to link this local repository to it?"
**Agent:** `git remote add origin <YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL>` (User replaces `<YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL>`)

**User:** "Now, push the changes from my local `main` branch to the `main` branch on GitHub."
**Agent:** `git push -u origin main`
